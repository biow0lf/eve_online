        Derelik region, sovereign seat of the Ammatar Mandate, became the shield to
        the Amarrian flank in the wake of the Minmatar Rebellion. Derelik witnessed
        many hostile exchanges between the Amarr and rebel forces as the latter tried
        to push deeper into the territory of their former masters. Having held their
        ground, thanks in no small part to the Ammatars'' military efforts, the Amarr
        awarded the Ammatar with their own province. However, this portion of space
        shared borders with the newly forming Minmatar Republic as well as the Empire,
        and thus came to be situated in a dark recess surrounded by hostiles. \n\nGiven
        the lack of safe routes elsewhere, the local economies of this region were
        dependent on trade with the Amarr as their primary means of survival. The
        Ammatar persevered over many decades of economic stagnation and limited trade
        partners, and their determination has in recent decades been rewarded with
        an increase in economic prosperity. This harsh trail is a point of pride for
        all who call themselves Ammatar, and it has bolstered their faith in the Amarrian
        way to no end.","name":"Derelik","region_id":10000001}'
